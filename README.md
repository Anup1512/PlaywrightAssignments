Day 1 Assignment:

3. Difference between "Var" and "let"
   (i) Var allows redeclaration and reassignment but let does not allow to redeclare. However, we can reassign using let
   (ii) Var is global scoping whereas let is block scoping
   (iii) Hoisting occurs while using both Var and let. However, reference error would be thrown for let (Can't access before initialization)
